  "content": "Your patients may see or smell mold on clothing, drywall, furniture, cardboard boxes, or books, but mold may also be hidden under or behind items like carpet, cushions, or walls.\nCDC recommends removal no matter what type of mold is present. Sampling for mold can be expensive, and there are no set standards to determine the different kinds of mold in a building. The best thing to do is to safely remove the mold and prevent future mold growth."
