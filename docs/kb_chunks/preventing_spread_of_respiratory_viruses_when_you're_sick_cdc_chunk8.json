  "content": "When, for at least 24 hours, your symptoms are getting better overall and you have not had a fever (and are not using fever-reducing medication), you are typically less contagious, but it still takes more time for your body to fully get rid of the virus. During this time, you may still be able to spread the virus to others. Using precautions for the next 5 days can help reduce this risk. After this 5-day period, you are typically much less likely to be contagious"
