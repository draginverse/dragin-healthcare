Virus particles do not build up in the air outdoors as much as they do indoors.\nHow it works\nSome germs spread in the air between people. This happens more easily in indoor, crowded spaces with poor airflow. To reduce the risk of exposure, it helps to improve air quality by increasing airflow, cleaning the air, or opting to gather outdoors."
