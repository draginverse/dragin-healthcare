If you need to use your reliever medicine more and more, visit your doctor to see if you need a different medicine. Controller medicines help you have fewer and milder asthma attacks.\nAsthma medicines can have side effects. Most side effects are mild and soon go away. Ask your doctor about the side effects of your medicines."
