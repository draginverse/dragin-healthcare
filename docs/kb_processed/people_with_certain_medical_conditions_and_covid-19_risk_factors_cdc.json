More than 81% of COVID-19 deaths occur in people over age 65.\nThe number of deaths\namong people over age 65 is 97 times higher than among people ages 18-29 years.\nYour risk of severe illness from COVID-19 increases as the number of your underlying medical conditions increases.\nSome people are at increased risk of getting very sick or dying from COVID-19 because of where they live or work, or because they can’t get health care. This includes many\npeople from racial and ethnic minority groups\nand\npeople with disabilities\n.\nSpecific information on children and teens\nPeople of all ages, including children and teens, can get very sick from COVID-19, especially those with underlying medical conditions.

Pemgarda is not a treatment for COVID-19. Talk to your healthcare provider to see if Pemgarda is right for you. CDC is monitoring variants and how commonly they occur to understand if they might affect how well Pemgarda works.
