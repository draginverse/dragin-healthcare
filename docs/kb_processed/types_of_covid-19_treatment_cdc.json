If you don’t have a healthcare provider, contact your local pharmacy, community health center or health department.\nDon't Delay\nTreatment must be started within 5-7 days of when your symptoms first start.\nPeople who are more likely to get very sick include:\nOlder adults\n(especially those ages 65 years or older, with risk increasing with advancing age)\nPeople who are unvaccinated or are not\nup to date\non their COVID-19 vaccinations\nPeople with certain medical conditions\n, such as chronic lung disease, heart disease, or a weakened immune system.\nStaying up to date with your COVID-19 vaccinations makes you much less likely to get very ill, be hospitalized, or even die from COVID-19. Treatment can further reduce the risk for COVID-19 hospitalization and death among vaccinated people, especially those at higher risk for severe illness.\nTreatments\nFDA has authorized or approved several antiviral medications used to treat mild to moderate COVID-19 in people who are more likely to get very sick.\nAntiviral medications\ntarget specific parts of the virus to stop it from multiplying in the body once someone is infected, helping to prevent severe illness and death.\nThe Infectious Diseases Society of America provides\nGuidelines on the Treatment and Management of Patients with COVID-19\nfor healthcare providers to help them work with their patients and determine the best treatment options for their patients. Several treatment options are available for treating COVID-19. They include:\nCOVID-19 Treatment\nTreatment\nWho (Among people who are at high risk of getting sick)\nWhen\nHow\nNirmatrelvir with Ritonavir (Paxlovid)\nAntiviral\nAdults; children ages 12 years and older\nStart as soon as possible; must begin within 5 days of when symptoms start\nTaken at home by mouth (orally)\nVeklury (remdesivir)\nAntiviral\nAdults and children\nStart as soon as possible; must begin within 7 days of when symptoms start\nIntravenous (IV) infusions at a healthcare facility for 3 consecutive days\nMolnupiravir (Lagevrio)\nAntiviral\nAdults\nStart as soon as possible; must begin within 5 days of when symptoms start\nTaken at home by mouth (orally)\nSome treatments might have side effects or interact with other medications you are taking. Side effects vary for each medication. For example, Paxlovid can cause a metallic taste in your mouth which goes away when you stop taking the medication. Paxlovid is more likely to interact with other medications than other COVID-19 antivirals, but most people can still take it. Check with your healthcare provider or pharmacist if you are taking other medications to make sure that COVID-19 treatments can be safely taken at the same time.\nIf you are hospitalized, your healthcare provider might use other types of medications, depending on how sick you are. These could include medications to treat the virus, reduce an overactive immune response, or treat COVID-19 complications.\nIf you have a weakened immune system, have received antiviral treatment, and continue to experience COVID-19 symptoms, your healthcare provider may recommend additional treatment, including convalescent plasma.\nAccessing Treatment\nVisit\nTreatment Locator (hhs.gov)\nor call 1-800-232-0233 (TTY 1-888-720-7489) to find a location that offers testing and treatment or a pharmacy where you can fill your prescription.\nDid you know?\nCOVID-19 oral antiviral treatments Paxlovid and Lagevrio are available for certain people at a lower cost.\nPatient assistance programs\nare available to people who are underinsured, uninsured, and who are on Medicare or Medicaid to lower their out-of-pocket costs. You should enroll in these programs to learn if you can receive assistance for specific medications, regardless of your insurance status. Call ahead to your healthcare provider and insurer to confirm coverage eligibility.\nPeople have been seriously harmed (and have even died) after taking products not approved for use to treat or prevent COVID-19, even if they were approved or prescribed for other uses. The\nright medications for COVID-19\ncan help reduce your risk of severe illness\n.\nTalk to a healthcare provider about taking medications to treat COVID-19.\nPreventing COVID-19\nCOVID-19 Vaccines\nA COVID-19 vaccine is the first step to prevent severe health outcomes. Antiviral treatments are not a replacement for COVID-19 vaccinations.\nCOVID-19 vaccines available in the United States effectively protect people from getting seriously ill, being hospitalized, and even dying. As with vaccines for other diseases, you are protected best when you\nstay up to date.\nWhere to find free COVID-19 vaccines this season\nFree COVID-19 vaccines may be available through private health insurance, Medicare, Medicaid, public health safety net programs, and CDC's Vaccines for Children Program.\nFind your free COVID-19 vaccine\nPeople with weakened immune systems, who are at higher risk for severe COVID-19 and might have decreased response to vaccination, may require additional doses of COVID-19 vaccine.\nKeep Reading:\nVaccines for Moderately to Severely Immunocompromised People\nAlongside vaccination,\npracticing core prevention strategies\nlike good hygiene, taking steps for cleaner air, and staying home when sick is vital in preventing the spread of COVID-19.\nPre-exposure Prophylaxis (Medication for Preventing COVID-19)\nFDA has\nauthorized\na preventive monoclonal antibody for people who are\nmoderately or severely immunocompromised\n, ages 12 years and older, and weigh at least 88 pounds. In addition to vaccination,\nPemivibart (Pemgarda™)\nmay provide another layer of protection against COVID-19 and can be given at least 2 weeks after receiving a COVID-19 vaccine.\nA healthcare provider gives Pemgarda as a single intravenous infusion over 60 minutes at a doctor's office or healthcare facility. If continued protection is needed, additional doses should be administered every 3 months.\nPeople who are privately insured or have Medicare part B may receive Pemgarda for free. Talk to your healthcare provider to see if Pemgarda is right for you. CDC is monitoring variants of the virus that causes COVID-19 and how commonly they occur to understand if they might affect how well Pemgarda works.  The FDA will provide additional updates to the Emergency Use Authorization materials, as appropriate, if new information emerges.  This is the only preventive option available for COVID-19 for the immunocompromised community, as described above, at the present time.\nRecovery\nManage Symptoms\nMost people with COVID-19 have mild illness and can recover at home. You can treat symptoms with over-the-counter medicines, such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen, to help feel better.\nCOVID-19 Rebound\nCOVID-19 rebound is a return of symptoms or a new positive test 3-7 days after:\nrecovering from the initial illness, or\nhaving tested negative for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.\nPeople may experience rebound whether they received COVID-19 antiviral medication or not. Rebound symptoms are typically mild and resolve in a few days.\nStudies suggest there is no increased risk of severe COVID-19 illness in people who experience COVID-19 rebound after antiviral medication.\nThe benefits of COVID-19 treatment outweigh the risk of rebound if you are at high risk for severe COVID-19. Talk to your healthcare provider if you think you may have rebound. If you don't have a healthcare provider, contact your local community health center or health department.\nResources\nGeneral Treatment Resources\nCoronavirus (COVID-19) Drugs\nCOVID-19 Therapeutics Locator\nOral Antiviral Treatment Resources\nWhat Are Oral Antivirals?\nPAXCESS™ Patient Support Program [PDF – 4 pages]\nPaxlovid | HHS/ASPR\nMerck Patient Assistance Program\nGilead’s Advancing Access\nU.S. Government Patient Assistance (USG PAP)\nMarch 10, 2025\nSources\nPrint\nShare\nFacebook\nLinkedIn\nTwitter\nSyndicate\nContent Source:\nNational Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases\n;\nCoronavirus and Other Respiratory Viruses Division"
