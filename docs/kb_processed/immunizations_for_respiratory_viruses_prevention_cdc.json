View this Fall and Winter Virus Season Immunization Guide to ensure you know which vaccines are recommended for you.\nEspañol\nImmunizations‎\nStay up to date with the\nimmunizations that are recommended for you\n.\nFor most people that means getting a current flu and COVID-19 vaccine.\nEveryone ages 75 and older should get a respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine.\nCDC also recommends adults ages 60-74 who are\nat increased risk of severe RSV disease\nget an RSV vaccine.\nTo prevent severe RSV disease in infants, CDC recommends either the pregnant mother gets an RSV vaccine, or the infant gets an immunization with an RSV monoclonal antibody. Most infants will not need both.\nWhen making a vaccination plan, consider getting more than one vaccine at once. Flu, COVID-19, and RSV vaccines can be given at the same visit.\nFor people who prefer to get their recommended vaccines at different visits, you don't need to wait a specific amount of time after the previous vaccine to get your next one.\nYou might be due for other vaccines, like those to prevent pneumococcal disease, shingles, or whooping cough. Ask a healthcare provider which vaccines are recommended for you.\nHow it works\nImmunizations help prepare your body to defend itself from viruses and severe illness. Some immunizations teach your immune system what the virus looks like so it can prepare to protect against it. Other immunizations directly provide you with antibodies to protect you from the virus. Getting vaccinated can reduce your chances of getting infected to some degree, but its main strength is preventing severe illness and death. More and more evidence suggests that the COVID-19 vaccine can also lower your chances of developing Long COVID.\nSteps you can take\nIndividuals can\nTalk with a healthcare provider to make sure you are up to date on vaccines.\nReview the\nvaccine schedule\nto become familiar with the immunizations recommended for you and when you should get them.\nVisit\nwww.vaccines.gov\nto locate pharmacies with vaccines near you.\nLearn more about\nhow vaccine recommendations\nare made.\nTalk to your friends and family about the benefits of getting vaccinated.\nOrganizations can\nOrganize vaccination clinics at workplaces. This helps remove obstacles to accessing vaccines.\nPartner with trusted community members (such as doctors, nurses, health educators, or faith-based and community leaders) and have them attend vaccination events to share accurate information about vaccines.\nProvide employees with paid time off to get vaccinated and recover from any side effects.\nKey times for prevention\nAll of the prevention strategies described in this guidance can be helpful to reduce risk. They are especially helpful when:\nRespiratory viruses are causing a lot of\nillness in your community\n.\nYou or the people around you were recently exposed to a respiratory virus, are sick, or are recovering.\nYou or the people around you have\nrisk factors for severe illness\n.\nNotice\nCDC offers separate, specific guidance for healthcare settings (\nCOVID-19\n,\nflu\n, and\ngeneral infection prevention and control\n).\nFederal civil rights laws\nmay require reasonable modifications or reasonable accommodations in various circumstances. Nothing in this guidance is intended to detract from or supersede those laws.\nSeptember 11, 2024\nSources\nPrint\nShare\nFacebook\nLinkedIn\nTwitter\nSyndicate\nContent Source:\nNational Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases (NCIRD)"
