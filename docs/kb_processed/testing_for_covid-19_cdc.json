NAATs tests are the “gold standard” for COVID-19 tests.\nYour sample will usually be taken by a healthcare provider and transported to a laboratory for testing and may take up to 3 days to receive results. Some NAATs may be performed at the point-of-care and provide results more quickly.\nAntigen Tests\nAntigen Test results reflecting a positive result.\nAntigen tests* are rapid tests that usually produce results in 15-30 minutes. Positive results are accurate and reliable. However, in general, antigen tests are less likely to detect the virus than NAAT tests, especially when\nsymptoms\nare not present. Therefore, a single negative antigen test cannot rule out infection.\nTo be confident you do not have COVID-19,\nFDA recommends\n2 negative antigen tests for individuals with symptoms or 3 antigen tests for those without symptoms, performed 48 hours apart. A single NAAT test can be used to confirm an antigen test result.\n*Self-tests, or at-home tests, are antigen tests that can be taken anywhere without having to go to a specific testing site. Read self-test package inserts thoroughly and follow the instructions closely when performing the test.\nWhen you get tested\nChoose the right type of test for your circumstance.\nWhen using an antigen test, follow the recommendations provided by FDA and the test's manufacturer.\nIf you do not, your results may be less likely to correctly indicate whether you have COVID-19 or not.\nChoosing a COVID-19 test\nI want to get tested and:\nI have not had COVID-19 or I have not had a positive test within the past 90 days.\nYou may choose a NAAT, including PCR, or antigen test. If you use an antigen test and your result is negative, repeat testing following\nFDA recommendations\n.\nI tested positive for COVID-19 in the last 90 days.\nMy first positive test result was within 30 days or less:\nI have symptoms:\nUse an antigen test. Repeat negative tests following\nFDA recommendations\n.\nI do not have symptoms:\nTesting is not recommended to detect a new infection.\nMy first positive test result was within 31-90 days:\nI have symptoms:\nUse an antigen test. Repeat negative tests following\nFDA recommendations\n.\nI do not have symptoms:\nUse an antigen test. Repeat negative tests following\nFDA recommendations\n.\nAfter a positive test result, you may continue to test positive for some time. Some tests, especially NAAT tests, may continue to show a positive result for up to 90 days.\nReinfections\ncan occur within 90 days, which can make it hard to know if a positive test indicates a new infection.\nConsider consulting a healthcare provider if you have any questions or concerns about your circumstances.\nGetting a COVID-19 test\nBuy self-tests (at-home tests)\nBuy self-tests (at-home tests) online or in pharmacies and retail stores. If you have health insurance, it may reimburse the cost of purchasing self-tests. Visit\nFDA's website\nfor a list of authorized tests.\nGo to a testing location\nVisit a\ncommunity-based testing location\n, such as a pharmacy or\nhealth center\nnear you. These locations may offer NAAT, including PCR, or antigen tests, and provide low- or no-cost testing. Free NAAT or antigen tests may also be available through your\nlocal health department\n.\nTalk to a doctor or healthcare provider about other testing options that may be available to you.\nIf you are a person with a disability, the\nDisability Information and Access Line\ncan help you access a test or find a test location.\nInterpreting your results\nIf your COVID-19 test is positive\nA positive COVID-19 test means the virus was detected and\nyou have or recently had an infection\n.\nTake steps to\nprevent spreading\nCOVID-19.\nMonitor your\nsymptoms\n. If you have any\nemergency warning signs\n, seek emergency care immediately.\nSeek health care right away for\ntreatment\nif you have\nrisk factors\nfor severe illness. Treatment may be an option to make your symptoms less severe and shorten the time you are sick. Treatment needs to be started within a few days of when your symptoms begin.\nIf your COVID-19 test is negative\nA negative COVID-19 test means the test did not detect the virus, but this\ndoesn't rule out that you could have an infection\n. If you used an antigen test, follow\nFDA recommendations for repeat testing\n.\nIf you have symptoms:\nYou may have COVID-19 but tested before the virus was detectable.\nYou may have another viral infection or illness.\nTake actions to help protect yourself and others\nfrom health risks caused by respiratory viruses.\nContact a healthcare provider if you have any questions about your test result.\nMarch 10, 2025\nSources\nPrint\nShare\nFacebook\nLinkedIn\nTwitter\nSyndicate\nContent Source:\nNational Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases\n;\nCoronavirus and Other Respiratory Viruses Division"
