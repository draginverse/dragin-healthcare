If you have asthma, people should never smoke near you.\nDust mites\ncan trigger an asthma attack. Dust mites are microscopic bugs that are in many homes. To prevent attacks:\nUse allergen-proof mattress and pillowcase covers.\nDon't use down-filled pillows, quilts, or comforters.\nWash your bedding weekly and dry it completely.\nVacuum regularly using a vacuum equipped with a HEPA filter.\nKeep relative humidity levels in the home low, around 30- 50%.\nAir pollution\ncan trigger an asthma attack. This pollution can come from factories, cars, or wildfire smoke. Pay attention to air quality forecasts on radio, television, and the internet.\nCockroaches and other pests\nare often found where food is eaten and crumbs are left behind. To control pests in your home:\nRemove as many water and food sources as you can.\nClean dishes, crumbs, and spills right away.\nStore food in airtight containers.\nKeep trash in a closed container.\nVacuum or sweep areas that might attract cockroaches or mice often.\nSeal cracks in cabinets, walls, baseboards, and around plumbing.\nAvoid using sprays and foggers as these can cause asthma attacks.\nFurry\npets\ncan trigger an asthma attack if you are allergic to them. If you think a furry pet may be causing attacks, you may want to find the pet another home. If you can't or don't want to find a new home for the pet, protect yourself by:\nKeeping pets out of bedrooms,\nWashing furry pets,\nUsing an air cleaner with a HEPA filter, and\nUsing allergen-proof mattress and pillow covers.\nPeople with asthma are not allergic to their pet's fur, so trimming a pet's fur will not help your asthma.\nBreathing in\nmold\ncan trigger an asthma attack whether or not you are allergic to mold. Indoors mold grows in damp areas such as kitchens, bathrooms, and basements, or where water damage has occurred.  Get rid of mold in your home to control your attacks. To reduce mold exposure in your home:\nDry damp or wet items within 24 to 48 hours to prevent mold growth.\nFix water leaks as soon as you can.\nReplace ceiling tiles and carpet if they are moldy.\nUse an air conditioner or a dehumidifier to keep indoor humidity low.\nKeep humidity under 50%. Check more than once a day with a hygrometer.\nScrub mold off hard surfaces with detergent and water. Dry completely.\nRun the bathroom exhaust fan or open the window when showering.\nOther triggers\nfor an asthma attack include:\nInfections linked to flu, colds, and RSV\nSinus infections, allergies, or pollen\nBreathing in some chemicals or fragrances\nAcid reflux\nBad weather, such as thunderstorms or high humidity and cold, dry air\nSome foods and medicines for people allergic to them\nPhysical exercise or strong emotions that lead to very fast breathing\nJanuary 22, 2024\nSources\nPrint\nShare\nFacebook\nLinkedIn\nTwitter\nSyndicate\nContent Source:\nNational Center for Environmental Health"
