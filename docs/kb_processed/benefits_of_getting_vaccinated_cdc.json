If you do get COVID-19, vaccines can make the illness shorter\n4\n5\nand less severe.\nStay up to date\nLearn about the latest recommendations for the 2024-2025 COVID-19 vaccine.\nStay Up to Date with COVID-19 Vaccines\nThe data below describe how well vaccines work to reduce your risk. This risk reduction is in addition to protection you may have from previous infections with COVID-19 or from receiving earlier versions of COVID-19 vaccines.\nCOVID-19 vaccines:\nReduce your risk for critical illness\n(admission to intensive care unit or death)\nFor adults ages 18 and older, the 2023–2024 COVID-19 vaccines reduced the risk of critical illness from COVID-19 by almost 70% in the first 2 months after vaccination. Protection decreased over time. During the 10 months after vaccination, the vaccines reduced critical illness risk by about 50%.\n6\nReduce your risk of being hospitalized\nFor adults ages 18 and older, the 2023­­–2024 COVID-19 vaccines reduced the risk of COVID-19 hospitalization by about 50% in the first 2 months after vaccination. Protection decreased over time. During the 10 months after vaccination, the vaccines reduced hospitalization risk by about 30%.\n6\n7\nReduce your risk of getting sick and needing to go to urgent care or the emergency department\nFor adults ages 18 and older, the 2023–2024 COVID-19 vaccines reduced the risk of COVID-19 urgent care and emergency department visits by about 50% in the first 2 months after vaccination. Protection decreased over time, with little protection remaining at 4–6 months.\n6\n7\nReduce your risk for Long COVID\nStudies show that people who got vaccinated against COVID-19 and later get COVID-19 are less likely to have Long COVID, compared to people who are unvaccinated or not up to date with their COVID-19 vaccines.\n8\n9\nImportant for people at higher risk from COVID-19\nIf you are 65 years or older\nThe 2023–2024 COVID-19 vaccines reduced the risk of critical illness (admission to intensive care unit or death) among older adults by about 67% in the first 2 months after vaccination. During the 4–6 months after vaccination, the vaccines reduced critical illness risk by about 40%.\n6\nThe 2023–2024 COVID-19 vaccines reduced the risk of COVID-19 hospitalization among older adults by about 50% in the first 2 months after vaccination. Protection from vaccination wanes by 4–6 months after vaccination.\n6\n7\nBecause adults ages 65 years and older have a higher risk for severe COVID-19, they are recommended to receive a second dose of COVID-19 vaccine 6 months after their first dose.\nIf you have a\nweakened immune system\nThe 2023–2024 COVID-19 vaccines reduced the risk of COVID-19 hospitalization for people with a weakened immune system by about 36% in the first 2 months after vaccination. Protection from vaccination wanes by 4–6 months after vaccination.\n6\n10\nBecause people with a weakened immune system have a higher risk for severe COVID-19, they are recommended to receive a second dose of COVID-19 vaccine 6 months after their first dose.\nIf you are\npregnant\nGetting a COVID-19 vaccine while you are pregnant helps protect you. It also helps protect your baby from severe health outcomes due to COVID-19 before they become\neligible for COVID-19 vaccination\nwhen they are 6 months old.\n11\nDuring October 2022–April 2024, 1,470 infants less than 6 months old were hospitalized with COVID-19.\n12\nMaternal vaccination during pregnancy reduced the risk of COVID-19-related hospitalization by around 54% among infants during the first 3 months of life.\n11\nChildren\nThe 2023–2024 COVID-19 vaccines reduced the risk of COVID-19-associated emergency room and urgent care visits by\nAround 65% in children\nages 9 months to 4 years\nin the first 2 months after vaccination. Protection decreased over time.\n6\nAbout 70% in children\nages 5–17 years\nin the first 2 months after vaccination. Protection decreased over time. At 4–6 months after vaccination, the vaccines reduced risk by about 50%.\n6\nKeep Reading:\n6 Things to Know about COVID-19 Vaccination for Children\nVaccination is more reliable way to build protection than getting sick\nCOVID-19 vaccination helps protect people by creating an immune response without the potentially severe illness that can be associated with COVID-19 infection.\nWhat Can Happen If You Get Sick with COVID-19\nCOVID-19 can cause severe illness or death, even in children, but it is not always possible to determine who will experience mild or severe illness from COVID-19 infection.\nPeople may have long-term health issues after having COVID-19. Even people who do not have symptoms when they are first infected with COVID-19 can experience long-term health problems, also known as\nLong COVID\nor post-COVID conditions.\nComplications can appear after mild or severe COVID-19, or after\nmultisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C)\n.\nProtection from having had COVID-19\nKeep in mind\nWhile people can get some protection from having COVID-19, the level and length of that protection varies, especially as COVID-19 variants continue to emerge.\nImmunity (protection) from infection can vary depending on how mild or severe someone's illness was, their age, and whether they have a weakened immune system. Immunity also changes depending on what variant of SARS-CoV-2 someone had and how similar it is to the variants currently circulating.\nImmunity from infection decreases over time.\nA closer look at the safety data\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, COVID-19 vaccines underwent the most intensive safety analysis in U.S. history. COVID-19 vaccines continue to be monitored for safety, even after FDA approval, to make sure they continue to meet FDA's standards for safety and effectiveness.\nTo date, the systems in place to monitor the safety of COVID-19 vaccines currently used in the United States have identified anaphylaxis and myocarditis or pericarditis as serious types of adverse events following COVID-19 vaccination. Other rare events, such as\nGuillain-Barré syndrome (GBS)\n, are also monitored for and studied.\nRead more about COVID-19 vaccine safety\nAfter vaccination\nLearn what you can do after vaccination to protect your family from COVID-19 in CDC's\nrespiratory virus guidance\n.\nJanuary 12, 2025\nSources\nPrint\nShare\nFacebook\nLinkedIn\nTwitter\nSyndicate\nContent Source:\nNational Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases\n;\nCoronavirus and Other Respiratory Viruses Division\nReferences\nPreliminary Estimates of COVID-19 Burden for 2024-2025 | COVID-19 | CDC\nCDC COVID Data Tracker: Trends by Geographic Area\nMortality in the United States — Provisional Data, 2023 | MMWR\nCOVID-19 vaccination decreased COVID-19 hospital length of stay, in-hospital death, and increased home discharge - PMC\nPrevention and Attenuation of Covid-19 with the BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 Vaccines | New England Journal of Medicine\nCOVID-19 vaccine effectiveness\nInterim Effectiveness of Updated 2023–2024 (Monovalent XBB.1.5) COVID-19 Vaccines Against COVID-19–Associated Emergency Department and Urgent Care Encounters and Hospitalization Among Immunocompetent Adults Aged ≥18 Years — VISION and IVY Networks, September 2023–January 2024 | MMWR\nProtective Effect of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Vaccination on Postacute Sequelae of COVID-19: A Multicenter Study From a Large National Health Research Network | Open Forum Infectious Diseases | Oxford Academic\nProtective effect of COVID-19 vaccination against long COVID syndrome: A systematic review and meta-analysis - ScienceDirect\nInterim Effectiveness of Updated 2023–2024 (Monovalent XBB.1.5) COVID-19 Vaccines Against COVID-19–Associated Hospitalization Among Adults Aged ≥18 Years with Immunocompromising Conditions — VISION Network, September 2023–February 2024 | MMWR\nEffectiveness of Maternal mRNA COVID-19 Vaccination During Pregnancy Against COVID-19–Associated Hospitalizations in Infants Aged 6 Months During SARS-CoV-2 Omicron Predominance — 20 States, March 9, 2022–May 31, 2023 | MMWR\nCOVID-19–Associated Hospitalizations and Maternal Vaccination Among Infants Aged 6 Months — COVID-NET, 12 States, October 2022–April 2024 | MMWR"
