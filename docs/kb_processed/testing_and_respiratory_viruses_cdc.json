There are various types of tests for respiratory virus infections. Antigen tests (“self-tests” or “rapid tests”) usually return results quickly (around 15 minutes). Nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs), which include polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests, are normally conducted by a healthcare provider. Although antigen tests are usually faster, they are not as good at detecting viruses as NAATs. This means that you might get a negative result with an antigen test, but actually be infected with the virus.\nHow it works\nTests can help you find out if you are currently infected with a certain respiratory virus. While testing doesn't change how likely you are to catch or spread respiratory viruses, or how severe your illness might be, it can provide useful information to help you make prevention or treatment choices.\nSteps you can take\nIndividuals can\nPlan in advance of any illness so you can be ready to get tested quickly, particularly if you are someone who could benefit from treatment for respiratory viruses.\nAntigen tests can be used for screening before gathering with others, especially to help protect people in your life who have\nrisk factors for severe illness\n. However, false negatives are possible; false positives are uncommon.\nOrganizations can\nProvide employees with paid time off to seek testing for respiratory viruses, as needed.\nKey times for prevention\nAll of the prevention strategies described in this guidance can be helpful to reduce risk. They are especially helpful when:\nRespiratory viruses are causing a lot of\nillness in your community\n.\nYou or the people around you were recently exposed to a respiratory virus, are sick, or are recovering.\nYou or the people around you have\nrisk factors for severe illness\n.\nNotice\nCDC offers separate, specific guidance for healthcare settings (\nCOVID-19\n,\nflu\n, and\ngeneral infection prevention and control\n).\nFederal civil rights laws\nmay require reasonable modifications or reasonable accommodations in various circumstances. Nothing in this guidance is intended to detract from or supersede those laws.\nMarch 1, 2024\nSources\nPrint\nShare\nFacebook\nLinkedIn\nTwitter\nSyndicate\nContent Source:\nNational Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases (NCIRD)"
