They may also get more age-appropriate doses, beyond two doses at least 2 months apart, after talking to a healthcare provider.\nPeople can self-confirm as moderately or severely immunocompromised. This means they do NOT need documentation to receive a COVID-19 vaccination they are eligible for.\nWhile it is the\nrecommended\nto get 2024-2025 COVID-19 vaccine doses 6 months apart, the\nminimum\ntime is 2 months apart, which allows flexibility to get the second dose prior to typical COVID-19 surges, travel, life events, and healthcare visits.\nIf I am pregnant or planning to become pregnant, can I get a COVID-19 vaccine?\nYes, COVID-19 vaccination is recommended if you are\npregnant\n,\nbreastfeeding a baby\n, trying to get pregnant now, or\nmight become pregnant in the future\n.\nCOVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy helps:\nPrevent severe illness and death in women who are pregnant.\nProtect babies younger than 6 months old\nfrom hospitalization.\nLearn more about vaccination considerations and the\nsafety and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines\nduring pregnancy or while breastfeeding.\nDo I need to wait after getting a flu vaccine or other vaccine before getting a COVID-19 vaccine?\nThere is no recommended waiting period between getting a\nCOVID-19 vaccine and other vaccines\n. You can get a COVID-19 vaccine and other vaccines, including a\nflu vaccine\n, at the same visit\nCan I get vaccinated against COVID-19 while sick with COVID-19?\nNo. You should wait to be vaccinated to avoid potentially exposing healthcare personnel and others during the vaccination visit.\nStay home and away from others\n(including people you live with who are not sick) if you have a respiratory virus. You can go back to your normal activities when, for at least 24 hours, both are true:\nYour symptoms are getting better overall,\nand\nYou have not had a fever (and are not using fever-reducing medication).\nWhen you go back to your normal activities, take added precaution over the next 5 days, such as taking additional\nsteps for cleaner air\n, hygiene,\nmasks\n,\nphysical distancing\n, and/or testing when you will be around other people indoors.\nLearn more about the\nbenefits of getting a COVID-19 vaccine\n.\nIf I already had COVID-19 and recovered, do I still need to get a COVID-19 vaccine?\nYes, vaccination remains the best available protection against the most severe outcomes of COVID-19, including hospitalization and death, even if you have previously been infected. If you recently had COVID-19, you may consider delaying a COVID-19 vaccine dose by 3 months from when your symptoms started or from a positive test. Studies show:\nA longer time between infection and vaccination might give you a better immune response to vaccination.\nA low risk or reinfection has generally been seen in the first few months following infection.\nThere are some reasons you might get a vaccine sooner rather than later:\nYour risk of severe COVID-19\nIf COVID-19 is causing a lot of\nillness in your community\nLearn more about the\nbenefits of getting a COVID-19 vaccine\n.\nGetting Children and Teens Vaccinated\nAre the COVID-19 vaccines for children the same ones that are given to adults?\nThe COVID-19 vaccines for children have the same active ingredients as the vaccines given to adults. However, children receive a smaller, age-appropriate dose. The smaller doses were rigorously tested and found to create the needed immune response for each age group.\nWhy should my children and teens get vaccinated against COVID-19?\nWhile most children and teens with no underlying conditions have mild COVID-19 illness, some can still experience more severe illness, hospitalization, and death. Getting\nchildren and teens vaccinated against COVID-19\ncan help keep them from getting seriously ill if they do get COVID-19, including protecting them from short- and long-term complications and hospitalization.\nLearn more about the\nbenefits of getting a COVID-19 vaccine\n.\nIs there any reason to wait to get my child vaccinated?\nNo. Parents and caregivers should get their child (6 months and older) vaccinated as soon as possible. Getting vaccinated provides the best protection against serious illness if a child gets infected with the virus that causes COVID-19.\nSafety\nWhat are the risks of getting a COVID-19 vaccine?\nAdults and children may have some side effects from a COVID-19 vaccine, including pain, redness or swelling at the injection site, tiredness, headache, muscle pain, chills, fever, and nausea. These side effects typically resolve after a few days.\nSerious side effects\nare rare but may occur.\nWhat are the ingredients in COVID-19 vaccines?\nVaccine ingredients vary by manufacturer. None of the  COVID-19 vaccines contain eggs, gelatin, latex, or preservatives.\nLearn more about the ingredients in COVID-19 vaccines:\nPfizer BioNTech\nModerna\nNovavax\nAre COVID-19 vaccines safe even though they were developed quickly?\nResearch and development on vaccines like the COVID-19 vaccines have been underway for decades. All steps were taken to ensure that COVID-19 vaccines meet FDA's high standards for safety and efficacy. The steps include:\nClinical Trials\n– All vaccines in the United States must go through\nthree phases of clinical trials\nto ensure safety and efficacy. With the COVID-19 vaccine, the phases overlapped to speed up the process, but all phases were completed.\nAuthorization or Approval\n– Before vaccines are available to people, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reviews data from clinical trials. FDA has determined\nCOVID-19 vaccines\nmeet FDA’s safety and efficacy standards and has granted those vaccines\nEmergency Use Authorizations (EUAs)\nor full FDA approval.\nT\nracking Safety Using Vaccine Monitoring Systems\n– Like every vaccine approved for use in the United States, COVID-19 vaccines continue to be monitored for safety and effectiveness. Hundreds of millions of people in the United States have safely received COVID-19 vaccines. CDC and FDA provide updated information on the safety of U.S. authorized or approved COVID-19 vaccines using data from the\nVaccine Safety Datalink (VSD)\n,\nVaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS)\n, and other safety monitoring systems.\nLearn more about\ndeveloping COVID-19 vaccines\nand their\neffectiveness\n.\nBenefits\nWhy should I get vaccinated if I might get COVID-19 anyway?\nCOVID-19 vaccines help prevent disease, hospitalization, and death. Unvaccinated people are\nmore likely\nto get COVID-19 and much more likely to be hospitalized and to die from COVID-19, compared to people who are\nup to date\nwith their COVID-19 vaccinations.\nAfter Your Vaccine\nHow can I get a new CDC COVID-19 vaccination card?\nCDC no longer distributes the white CDC COVID-19 vaccination cards and\ndoes not\nmaintain vaccination records.\nYour state’s immunization information system (IIS) cannot issue you a vaccination card, but they can provide a digital or paper copy of\nyour full vaccination record\n, including your COVID-19 vaccinations. Contact your state health department’s\nIIS\n.\nI was vaccinated in another country. How do I transfer my proof of vaccination from that country to get a proof of vaccination card in the United States?\nThere are several ways you can update your records with vaccines you received while outside the United States.\nLearn more about\nVaccination Received Outside the United States\n.\nJanuary 30, 2025\nSources\nPrint\nShare\nFacebook\nLinkedIn\nTwitter\nSyndicate\nContent Source:\nNational Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases\n;\nCoronavirus and Other Respiratory Viruses Division"
