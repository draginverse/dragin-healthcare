Handwashing with soap removes germs from your hands, making them less likely to infect your respiratory system when you touch your eyes, nose, or mouth. If soap and water are not available, using a hand sanitizer with at least 60 percent alcohol can kill these germs. To remove germs and dirt on surfaces, use household cleaners that contain soap or detergent.\nSteps you can take\nIndividuals can\nCover your mouth and nose with a tissue when you\ncough or sneeze\n. Throw used tissues in the trash. If you don't have a tissue, cough or sneeze into your elbow, not your hands.\nLearn and use\nproper handwashing technique\n.\nTeach children\nthe correct way to wash their hands.\nClean frequently touched surfaces, such as countertops, handrails, and doorknobs regularly.\nOrganizations can\nOrder\nfree hygiene posters\nand display them in highly visible areas.\nMake sure facilities are equipped with soap, water, and a way to dry hands (for example, paper towels or a hand dryer).\nPlace hand sanitizer dispensers with at least 60 percent alcohol near frequently touched surfaces and in areas where soap and water are not easily accessible, such as near elevators, shared equipment, and building entrances and exits.\nClean frequently touched surfaces, such as countertops, handrails, and doorknobs regularly.\nKey times for prevention\nAll of the prevention strategies described in this guidance can be helpful to reduce risk. They are especially helpful when:\nRespiratory viruses are causing a lot of\nillness in your community\n.\nYou or the people around you were recently exposed to a respiratory virus, are sick, or are recovering.\nYou or the people around you have\nrisk factors for severe illness\n.\nNotice‎\nCDC offers separate, specific guidance for healthcare settings (\nCOVID-19\n,\nflu\n, and\ngeneral infection prevention and control\n).\nFederal civil rights laws\nmay require reasonable modifications or reasonable accommodations in various circumstances. Nothing in this guidance is intended to detract from or supersede those laws.\nMarch 1, 2024\nSources\nPrint\nShare\nFacebook\nLinkedIn\nTwitter\nSyndicate\nContent Source:\nNational Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases (NCIRD)"
