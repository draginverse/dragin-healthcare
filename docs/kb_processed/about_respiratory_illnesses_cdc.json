These illnesses share similar symptoms, risk factors, and prevention strategies.\nIn the United States, we have more tools than ever before to help people protect themselves, their families, and communities from severe respiratory illnesses.\nOverview\nProtect Yourself This Respiratory Virus Season\nYou don't want anything to get in your way. Make the most of every day and get this season's flu, COVID-19, and RSV vaccines.\nEvery year, respiratory viruses such as influenza (flu), COVID-19, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) cause hundreds of thousands of hospitalizations and thousands of deaths during the fall and winter virus season.\nCommon respiratory viral illnesses\nFlu\nCOVID-19\nRSV\nAdenovirus\nRhinovirus/Enterovirus (common cold)\nParainfluenza\nParvovirus B19 (Fifth Disease)\nSymptoms\nRespiratory viruses may cause both upper respiratory tract symptoms (the vocal chords and above) and lower respiratory tract symptoms (below the vocal chords). Some viruses also affect the nose, throat and lungs, and can lead to serious lung infections, such as pneumonia.\nExamples of respiratory virus symptoms\nFever\nChills\nFatigue (tiredness)\nCough\nRunny or stuffy nose\nDecrease in appetite\nSore throat\nVomiting\nNew loss of taste or smell\nHeadache, muscle or body aches\nDiarrhea\nWeakness\nWhen to seek emergency care\nIf you have an emergency warning sign (like trouble breathing or chest pain), seek emergency medical care immediately.\nRisk factors\nIllnesses caused by common respiratory viruses like COVID-19, flu, and RSV can make anyone sick. However, some people have risk factors that can increase their chances of getting very sick (severe illness).\nGroups of people at a higher risk for respiratory illnesses\nOlder adults\nwhose immune systems tend to not work as well and are more likely to have underlying health conditions.\nYoung children\nhave immune systems that are still developing and small airways.\nPeople with weakened immune systems\ncan have lower defenses against infections and their bodies may have a harder time building lasting protection from immunization or prior infection.\nPeople with disabilities\nare more likely to have underlying medical conditions, live in congregate settings, or experience factors and conditions stemming from social determinants of health that increase their risk for poor outcomes from respiratory infections.\nPregnant and recently pregnant women\nbecause pregnancy can cause changes in the immune system, heart, and lungs that make people more likely to get very sick from respiratory viruses.\nPrevention\nThere are actions you can take to help protect yourself and others from health risks caused by respiratory viruses.\nWhat to do when you are sick\nCDC\nrecommends\nyou stay home and away from others until at least 24 hours after both your symptoms are getting better overall, and you have not had a fever (and are not using fever-reducing medication). Resume normal activities and use added prevention strategies over the next five days.\nCore prevention strategies\nImmunizations\nare available for all three major fall and winter respiratory diseases – flu, COVID-19, and RSV (for groups eligible for RSV immunization).\nWashing hands\nand\nimproving airflow\nin the places where people live and work are important to lowering risk from respiratory viruses.\nEffective treatments\nare available for those who get flu or COVID-19 and are recommended for those at higher risk for severe illness. Treatment can reduce severe illness, hospitalization, and death.\nAdditional prevention strategies\nEveryday actions\nlike\nmasking\nand\nphysical distancing\ncan provide an additional layer of protection.\nTests\nare available that can quickly detect these respiratory viruses so patients don’t delay treatment and other actions that can protect their family, friends, and coworkers.\nTreatment and recovery\nTreatment is a core prevention strategy to lower risk of severe illness from respiratory viruses.\nAntivirals vs. antibiotics\nDifferences\n: Antiviral medicines fight against viruses, while antibiotics fight against bacterial infections.\nSimiliarities\n: Neither antiviral medications or antibiotics are sold over the counter in the United States. You can only get them if you have a prescription from a health care provider.\nWidely available and effective treatments for respiratory viruses\nAntiviral medications for COVID-19 and flu work best when taken as soon as possible and are recommended for those at higher risk.\nCOVID-19 antiviral medications\ncut the risk of hospitalization due to COVID-19 by over half and the risk of death by even more (75%).\nFlu antiviral medications\ncan lessen flu symptoms and shorten the time you are sick by about a day. Starting antiviral treatment shortly after symptoms begin can also help reduce some flu complications.\nJuly 19, 2024\nSources\nPrint\nShare\nFacebook\nLinkedIn\nTwitter\nSyndicate\nContent Source:\nNational Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases (NCIRD)"
