These symptoms can include fever, chills, fatigue, cough, runny nose, and headache, among others.*\nYou can go back to your normal activities when, for at least 24 hours, both are true:\nYour symptoms are getting better overall,\nand\nYou have not had a fever (and are not using fever-reducing medication).\nWhen you go back to your normal activities, take added precaution over the next 5 days, such as taking additional\nsteps for cleaner air\n,\nhygiene,\nmasks\n,\nphysical distancing\n, and/or\ntesting\nwhen you will be around other people indoors. This is especially important to protect people with factors that increase their risk of severe illness from respiratory viruses.\nKeep in mind that you may still be able to spread the virus that made you sick, even if you are feeling better. You are likely to be less contagious at this time, depending on factors like how long you were sick or how sick you were.\nIf you develop a fever or you start to feel worse after you have gone back to normal activities, stay home and away from others again until, for at least 24 hours, both are true: your symptoms are improving overall, and you have not had a fever (and are not using fever-reducing medication). Then take added precaution for the next 5 days.\nExamples\nFor illustrative purposes, not to scale\nExample 1: Person with fever and symptoms.\nExample 2: Person with fever but no other symptoms.\nExample 3: Person with fever and other symptoms, fever ends but other symptoms take longer to improve.\nExample 4: Person gets better and then gets a fever.\nIf you never had symptoms but tested positive for a respiratory virus‎\nYou may be contagious. For the next 5 days: take added precaution, such as taking additional\nsteps for cleaner air\n,\nhygiene\n,\nmasks\n,\nphysical distancing\n, and/or\ntesting\nwhen you will be around other people indoors. This is especially important to protect people with factors that increase their risk of severe illness from respiratory viruses.\nHow it works\nWhen you have a respiratory virus infection, you can spread it to others. How long someone can spread the virus depends on different factors, including how sick they are (severity) and how long their illness lasts (duration), This is not the same for everyone.\nWhen, for at least 24 hours, your symptoms are getting better overall and you have not had a fever (and are not using fever-reducing medication), you are typically less contagious, but it still takes more time for your body to fully get rid of the virus. During this time, you may still be able to spread the virus to others. Using precautions for the next 5 days can help reduce this risk. After this 5-day period, you are typically much less likely to be contagious. However, some people, especially people with weakened immune systems, can continue to spread the virus for a longer period of time. For COVID-19, taking an\nantigen\ntest can help you know how likely you are to spread the virus. A positive test tends to mean it is more likely that you can spread the virus to others.\nSteps you can take\nIndividuals can\nConsider using additional prevention tools, such as taking\nsteps for cleaner air\n, being diligent about\nhygiene\n, and using\nmasks\nwhen you're home sick to protect others in your home. This can be especially helpful if you do not have space at home to stay entirely away from others.\nMonitor your symptoms. If you have an emergency warning sign (like trouble breathing or chest pain), seek emergency medical care immediately.\nOrganizations can\nAdvise people to stay home if they are sick.\nProvide employees with paid time off and develop flexible leave and telework policies to support workers to stay home if sick or to care for sick family members.\nAdopt flexible cancellation or refund policies for customers who are sick.\n*Symptoms may include but are not limited to chest discomfort, chills, cough, decrease in appetite, diarrhea, fatigue (tiredness), fever or feeling feverish, headache, muscle or body aches, new loss of taste or smell, runny or stuffy nose, sneezing, sore throat, vomiting, weakness, wheezing.\nNotice‎\nCDC offers separate, specific guidance for healthcare settings (\nCOVID-19\n,\nflu\n, and\ngeneral infection prevention and control\n).\nFederal civil rights laws\nmay require reasonable modifications or reasonable accommodations in various circumstances. Nothing in this guidance is intended to detract from or supersede those laws.\nFebruary 29, 2024\nSources\nPrint\nShare\nFacebook\nLinkedIn\nTwitter\nSyndicate\nContent Source:\nNational Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases (NCIRD)"
