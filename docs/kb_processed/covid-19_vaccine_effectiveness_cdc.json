CDC accomplishes these goals by:\nAssessing COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness in key populations and against key outcomes (see below)\nProviding timely data to evaluate effectiveness of new vaccine recommendations\nDetecting changes in COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness due to waning of vaccine-induced protection and emergence of new variants\nIncluding populations at high risk for severe COVID-19\nCommunicating findings to policy makers, the scientific community, the public, and other stakeholders\nResources\nVaccine Effectiveness Studies\nCOVID Data Tracker\nSeptember 10, 2024\nSources\nPrint\nShare\nFacebook\nLinkedIn\nTwitter\nSyndicate\nContent Source:\nNational Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases\n;\nCoronavirus and Other Respiratory Viruses Division\nSources\nNational Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases (NCIRD), Coronavirus and Other Respiratory Viruses Division"
