There is no single number that defines a “safe” distance, since spread of viruses can depend on many factors.\nHow it works\nGenerally, infectious droplets and particles build up closer to the person who is releasing them. The closer you are to someone who has a respiratory virus, the more likely you are to catch it.\nSteps you can take\nIndividuals can\nAvoid being near someone who has respiratory virus symptoms.\nAvoid crowded areas where you may be unable to maintain physical distance.\nOrganizations can\nProvide employees with paid time off and flexible telework policies to support workers to stay home if sick.\nKey times for prevention\nAll of the prevention strategies described in this guidance can be helpful to reduce risk. They are especially helpful when:\nRespiratory viruses are causing a lot of\nillness in your community\n.\nYou or the people around you were recently exposed to a respiratory virus, are sick, or are recovering.\nYou or the people around you have\nrisk factors for severe illness\n.\nNotice‎\nCDC offers separate, specific guidance for healthcare settings (\nCOVID-19\n,\nflu\n, and\ngeneral infection prevention and control\n).\nFederal civil rights laws\nmay require reasonable modifications or reasonable accommodations in various circumstances. Nothing in this guidance is intended to detract from or supersede those laws.\nFebruary 29, 2024\nSources\nPrint\nShare\nFacebook\nLinkedIn\nTwitter\nSyndicate\nContent Source:\nNational Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases (NCIRD)"
