Please call your medical provider for any other symptoms that are severe or concerning to you.\nDifference between flu and COVID-19\nInfluenza (Flu) and COVID-19 are both contagious respiratory illnesses, but they are caused by different viruses. COVID-19 is caused by infection with a coronavirus named SARS-CoV-2, and flu is caused by infection with one of the influenza viruses. You cannot tell the difference between flu and COVID-19 by symptoms alone because some of the symptoms are the same.\nSome nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs), including PCR tests, can differentiate between flu and COVID-19 at the same time. If one of these tests is not available, many\ntesting locations\nprovide flu and COVID-19 tests separately.\nKeep Reading:\nSimilarities and Differences between Flu and COVID-19\nResources\nVideos\nSymptoms of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (youtube.com)\nMarch 10, 2025\nSources\nPrint\nShare\nFacebook\nLinkedIn\nTwitter\nSyndicate\nContent Source:\nNational Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases\n;\nCoronavirus and Other Respiratory Viruses Division"
