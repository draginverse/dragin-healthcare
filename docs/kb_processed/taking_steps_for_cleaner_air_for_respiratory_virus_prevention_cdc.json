This can mean bringing in fresh outside air, purifying indoor air, or gathering outdoors. Virus particles do not build up in the air outdoors as much as they do indoors.\nHow it works\nSome germs spread in the air between people. This happens more easily in indoor, crowded spaces with poor airflow. To reduce the risk of exposure, it helps to improve air quality by increasing airflow, cleaning the air, or opting to gather outdoors.\nSteps you can take\nIndividuals can\nBring as much fresh air into your home as possible by opening doors and windows and/or using exhaust fans.\nIf your home has a central heating, ventilation, and air conditioning system (HVAC, a system with air ducts that go throughout the home) that has a filter, set the fan to the \"on\" position instead of \"auto\" when you have visitors and use pleated filters. Change your filter every three months or according to the manufacturer's instructions.\nUse a portable high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) cleaner.\nMove activities outdoors, where airflow is best.\nOrganizations can\nEnsure existing HVAC systems are providing at least the minimum outdoor air ventilation requirement in accordance with ventilation design codes. Applicable codes are based on the year of building construction or latest renovation and intended building occupancy.\nAim for 5 or more air changes per hour (ACH) of clean air. This can be achieved through any combination of central ventilation system, natural ventilation, or additional devices that provide equivalent ACH to your existing ventilation.\nKey times for prevention\nAll of the prevention strategies described in this guidance can be helpful to reduce risk. They are especially helpful when:\nRespiratory viruses are causing a lot of\nillness in your community\n.\nYou or the people around you were recently exposed to a respiratory virus, are sick, or are recovering.\nYou or the people around you have\nrisk factors for severe illness\n.\nNotice‎\nCDC offers separate, specific guidance for healthcare settings (\nCOVID-19\n,\nflu\n, and\ngeneral infection prevention and control\n).\nFederal civil rights laws\nmay require reasonable modifications or reasonable accommodations in various circumstances. Nothing in this guidance is intended to detract from or supersede those laws.\nMarch 1, 2024\nSources\nPrint\nShare\nFacebook\nLinkedIn\nTwitter\nSyndicate\nContent Source:\nNational Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases (NCIRD)"
