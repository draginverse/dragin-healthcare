If you have asthma, you have it all the time, but you will have asthma attacks only when something bothers your lungs.\nAn asthma attack may include coughing, chest tightness, wheezing, and trouble breathing. The attack happens in your body's airways, which are the paths that carry air to your lungs. As the air moves through your lungs, the airways become smaller, like the branches of a tree are smaller than the tree trunk. During an asthma attack, the sides of the airways in your lungs swell and the airways shrink. Less air gets in and out of your lungs, and mucous that your body makes clogs up the airways.\nYou can control your asthma by knowing the warning signs of an asthma attack, staying away from things that cause an attack, and following your doctor's advice.\nDiagnosis\nIt can be hard to tell if someone has asthma, especially in children under age 5. A doctor can help you find out if you have asthma.\nDuring a checkup, a doctor may ask if you cough a lot, especially at night. He or she may also ask whether your breathing problems are worse after physical activity or at certain times of year. The doctor may ask about chest tightness, wheezing, and colds lasting more than 10 days. He or she may ask whether anyone in your family has or has had asthma, allergies, or other breathing problems. The doctor may ask about your home and whether you have missed school or work or have trouble doing certain things.\nThe doctor may also do a breathing test, called spirometry, to find out how well your lungs are working. Spirometry tests how much air you breathe out after taking a very deep breath before and after you use asthma medicine.\nSymptom management\nTake your medicine exactly as your doctor tells you and stay away from things that can trigger an attack to control your asthma.\nEveryone with asthma does not take the same medicine.\nYou can breathe in some medicines and take other medicines as a pill. Asthma medicines can be used in several ways -- as reliever therapy or as controller therapy. If you need to use your reliever medicine more and more, visit your doctor to see if you need a different medicine. Controller medicines help you have fewer and milder asthma attacks.\nAsthma medicines can have side effects. Most side effects are mild and soon go away. Ask your doctor about the side effects of your medicines.\nResources and tools\nAsthma information in other languages:\nArabic\nChinese\nFrench\nGerman\nHaitian\nHindi\nKorean\nMongolian\nMyanmar (Burmese)\nPortuguese\nRussian\nSomali\nSpanish\nTagalog\nUrdu\nVietnamese\nChecklist for home visitors\nA trained home visitor can help find common asthma triggers in homes and discuss ways to reduce and remove triggers. Removing asthma triggers in the home, along with proper medical care can improve health.\nThe checklist is organized into a Core Assessment plus two appendices (Dust Mite Module and Mold and Moisture Module). The Core Assessment can be used for all types of housing and climates, but the additional modules can be used if dust mites or mold/moisture issues are suspected by the trained home visitor. The suggested action items in this checklist are generally simple and low cost.\nHome Characteristics and Asthma Triggers Checklist for Home Visitors\nDownload\nDownload\nCaracterísticas de la vivienda y desencadenantes del asma  Lista de verificación para quienes evalúan la vivienda (en Español)\nAsthmaHomeChecklist -P\nDownload\nDownload\nHome Characteristics and Asthma Triggers Checklist for Home Visitors Training\nDownload\nDownload\nThis training supplements information in the Home Characteristics and Asthma Triggers: Assessment Checklist for Home Visitors.\nJanuary 22, 2024\nSources\nPrint\nShare\nFacebook\nLinkedIn\nTwitter\nSyndicate\nContent Source:\nNational Center for Environmental Health"
